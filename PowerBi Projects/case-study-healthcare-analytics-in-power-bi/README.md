## Overview

This Power BI dashboard analyzes elective hip replacement inpatient stays across New York State hospitals. It enables stakeholders to benchmark length of stay (LOS), cost per discharge, and underlying clinical and operational drivers. Actionable visuals and AI-driven insights support healthcare leaders in improving quality, efficiency, and patient outcomes.

## Features

- **LOS & Cost Benchmarking:** Compare average LOS and cost per discharge by hospital/region.
- **Key Influencer Analysis:** Identify what factors most strongly impact LOS and cost.
- **Discharge Patterns:** Explore patient outcomes by severity, risk, and diagnosis.
- **Hospital Drilldowns:** Profile and benchmark any facility for rapid operational insight.

## Dashboard Snapshots

![LOS Comparison](./images/LOS_Comparison.jpg)
*Extreme severity of illness and high mortality risk are the top drivers of longer hospital stays.*

![Cost Comparison](./images/Cost_Comparison.jpg)
*Cost per discharge varies by region and hospital. Highest-cost and lowest-cost facilities are easily benchmarked.*

![Discharges by Severity](./images/Discharges_By_Severity.jpg)
*See discharge volumes, LOS, and cost patterns by case severity, risk, and outcomeâ€”supporting better patient flow and discharge planning.*

![Hospital Profile](./images/Hospital_Profile.jpg)
*Analyze each hospitalâ€™s LOS, cost, and outcomes by clinical characteristics for targeted quality improvement.*

## Key Insights

- Patients with **extreme severity** and **major/extreme mortality risk** show the longest hospital stays.
- Some hospital regions deliver hip replacements well below state average costs, highlighting process efficiency.
- The majority of discharges are minor or moderate severity; highest-risk patients stand to benefit most from targeted care interventions.
- Facility and diagnosis drilldowns enable administrators to identify and remedy specific operational inefficiencies.
