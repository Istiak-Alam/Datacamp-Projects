## Technical Implementation

**Data Source:**  
- Historical price, volume, and market cap data sourced from top public crypto APIs (e.g., CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko), exported as CSV.

**Data Storage:**  
- Raw CSVs kept locally and imported into Power BI Desktop for modeling.

**Update Frequency:**  
- Data updated monthly; can be automated with direct connections for production environments.

**ETL Process:**  
- Data extracted and fully transformed in Power Query (date formatting, field cleanup, null handling, ticker standardization).

**Connection Mode:**  
- Import mode for optimal reporting speed and full DAX compatibility.

**Data Transformation:**  
- Date normalization, missing value handling, coin ticker standardization, and price validation were all performed in Power Query.

**Data Modeling Challenges:**  
- Addressed incomplete datasets for newer coins, ensuring time alignment and data continuity for trend visualization.

**DAX Functions Used:**  
- CALCULATE, MAX, MIN, AVERAGEX for metrics; SWITCH for dynamic visuals based on year or category.

**KPIs:**  
- Market capitalization, trading volume, daily/monthly/yearly high, low, open, and close prices for each tracked cryptocurrency.

**Best Practices:**  
- Utilized clear number formatting, colorblind-safe palettes, concise axis labeling, and informative tooltips for accessibility.

**Performance Optimization:**  
- Aggregated data for long timeframes to ensure smooth visual performance and responsiveness.

**RLS:**  
- Not implemented, as all data is public.

**Data Validation:**  
- Cross-checked calculated metrics against public aggregator sites for consistency.

**End Users:**  
- Investors, financial analysts, students, and educators interested in cryptocurrency market trends.

**Data Refresh:**  
- Refreshed with each new CSV; production-ready for automation.

**Collaboration & Sharing:**  
- Dashboard published to Power BI Service for sharing; images and analyses exported for presentations and documentation.
