# Crime Data Analysis for LAPD

This project analyzes crime data from Los Angeles to help the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) optimize resource allocation by identifying patterns in criminal behavior. By examining factors such as crime types, times, locations, and victim demographics, the goal is to provide actionable insights that can improve police operations and community safety.

## Project Overview

The project uses publicly available crime data from Los Angeles, which includes over **185,000 records** of criminal incidents. The analysis focuses on:
- Identifying the times and locations with the highest crime rates.
- Investigating crime type distributions across the city.
- Analyzing victim demographics to provide insights for better community engagement.

The goal is to support LAPD by providing insights that will help in the effective allocation of police resources and the design of proactive crime prevention strategies.

## Data Overview

The dataset consists of the following columns:
- `DR_NO`: Division of Records Number (an official file number)
- `Date Rptd`: Date reported (MM/DD/YYYY)
- `DATE OCC`: Date of occurrence (MM/DD/YYYY)
- `TIME OCC`: Time of occurrence (24-hour military time)
- `AREA NAME`: Geographic area or patrol division
- `Crm Cd Desc`: Description of the crime committed
- `Vict Age`: Age of the victim
- `Vict Sex`: Sex of the victim (F for Female, M for Male, X for Unknown)
- `Vict Descent`: Descent of the victim (e.g., Black, Hispanic)
- `Weapon Desc`: Description of the weapon used (if applicable)
- `Status Desc`: Crime status (e.g., under investigation)
- `LOCATION`: Geographic location of the crime

## Key Findings

- **Crime Hotspots**: Some geographic areas experience significantly more crimes than others, which can be used to prioritize patrols.
- **Time-of-Day Analysis**: Certain crime types are more frequent at specific times of day, suggesting that additional resources may be needed during high-crime hours.
- **Demographics Insights**: Crime trends differ across various demographic groups, providing insights into targeted community interventions.
