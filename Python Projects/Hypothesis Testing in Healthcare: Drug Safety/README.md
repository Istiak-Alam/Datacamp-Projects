# Hypothesis Testing in Healthcare: Drug Safety

## Project Overview

This project analyzes data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted by GlobalXYZ to evaluate the safety of a new pharmaceutical drug compared to placebo. The investigation focuses on whether the drug increases the risk or severity of adverse effects, and explores demographic and clinical predictors of safety outcomes. This notebook presents hypothesis testing and evidence-based visualizations, enabling transparent and reproducible drug safety review.

## Key Insights

- **Adverse effects are significantly more common and severe in the drug group** compared to placebo.
- **Statistical testing (z-test, Mann-Whitney U)** confirms increased risk and event counts for the drug.
- **Visualizations** highlight group differences and demographic patterns.
- **Stakeholder Recommendation:** Regulatory labeling and patient risk communications should advise carefully about elevated adverse event risk, especially for older or female patients.
